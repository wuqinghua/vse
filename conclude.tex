A mobile voice search session consists of a first voice recognition phase followed by a web search phase. By gathering a unique dataset collected from one of the top search providers in China, we analyse the traffic from the voice search service based on packet-level traces. We find a considerable fraction of the flows suffering from very long completion time in both phases of the service, which motivates us to perform a detailed analysis on the TCP performance and its causes. We focus on the disparity that might exist between TCP upload (voice search) and download (web search result) and also the possible difference when using 3G and WiFi connection. We observed a better and more consistent performance of 3G flows compared to WiFi flows, mostly due to higher packet loss rate and larger RTT in WiFi. In fact, WiFi flows are more likely to use timeout retransmission for packet loss recovery. Timeout retransmission, if it ever occurs, dominates the flow completion time. RTT on the other hand plays an important role under no packet loss. We also classified the timeout retransmissions and found the different compositions of timeout retransmissions between WiFi flows and 3G flows. Overall, our observations constitute valuable insights for improving the user-perceived performance in voice search service, as well as shed light on the intricacies of TCP for short flows.

% A mobile voice search session consists of a first voice recognition phase followed by a web search phase. Analyzing the TCP performance of mobile voice search at server side can shed useful lights on the understanding of TCP short flows for both upload and download. By observing a unique dataset collected from a voice search service, we find a considerable fraction of outlier flows that suffer from very long completion time in both phases, which motivates us to perform a detailed analysis on the TCP performance and its causes. We focus on the disparity that might exist between TCP upload and download flows and also the possible difference when searching using 3G and WiFi connection. In particular, we analyzed timeout retransmission, an expensive operation for packet loss recovery as it dominates the completion time once it happens. We have made several key observations, which constitute valuable insights for improving the user-perceived performance in voice search service.
